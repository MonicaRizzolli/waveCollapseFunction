# *Wave Function Collapse*
## Overlapping model ##

I forked this code from the post  “Wave Collapse Function” algorithm in Processing" : https://discourse.processing.org/t/wave-collapse-function-algorithm-in-processing/12983

Generate procedural patterns from a sample image. 

Ported to Processing Phyton mode.
